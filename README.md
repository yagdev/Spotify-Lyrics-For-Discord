# Lyrics for Discord Rich Presence
This .NET app allows you to display your currently playing song alongside album cover and synced lyrics on Discord using your Spotify activity.
## For starters
Before you begin, here are a few essentials:
* You must first set the four values requested by the app. A tutorial on how to get such values is in this repo's Wiki
* By minimizing the app, the app goes into the system tray, and you can access it by pressing on the small Spotify logo
* Song lyrics are limited to those available in Spotify. This is because this app relies on Spotify's servers to gather lyric information
